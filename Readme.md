# node-babel-es2017-init
## What's that?
This is my personal "starting point" for any project that uses `ES2017`, I had to redo it too many times so I decided to have one.

## Details
### Structure
```sh
- src           # Where all js files are stored
- out           # Where all converted files goes after building them
package.json    # lol don't you know what's that?
.gitignore      # :) Same as above
.eslintrc.json  # lint configurations based on eslit-config-airbnb
.eslintignore   # ignore files to link
.babelrc        # configuration of Babel
```

### Instructions
-  First install modules: `npm install` 
-  If you want to run your program without building it: `npm run dev`
-  If you want to build your program: `npm run build` or (I think, not sure) `npm build`
